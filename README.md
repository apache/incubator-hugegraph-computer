hugegraph-computer is a distributed graph processing system for hugegraph. It is an implementation of [Pregel](https://kowshik.github.io/JPregel/pregel_paper.pdf). It runs on Kubernetes or YARN framework.

## Features

- Based on BSP(Bulk Synchronous Parallel) model, every iteration is a superstep.
- Auto memory management. The framework will split some data to disk, the framework will never OOM(Out of Memory).
- The part of edges or the messages of super node can be in memory, so you will never lose it.
- You can output the result to HDFS or HugeGraph, or any other system.
- Easy to develop a new algorithm. You need to focus on a vertex only, not to worry about messages transferring and memory.
